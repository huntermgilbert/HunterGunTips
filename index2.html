  <h1>Glossary & Things to Know</h1>

  <h3>General Terms</h3>
  <img src="linedUpCasing.jpg" alt="BulletC Casing Photo"/>
  <p> <b>Automatic Firearm: </b> is a firearm capable of automatically cycling the shooting process, without needing any more manual operation from the user than simply keeping a trigger depressed. The action of an automatic firearm is capable of harvesting the excess energy released from a previous discharge to feed a new ammunition round into the chamber, and then ignite the propellant and discharge the projectile by delivering a hammer/striker impact on the primer. </p>
  <p> <b>Bullet:</b> contrary to what you may think you (maybe you already knew this) the bullet is actually just the projectile that a firearms shoots/projects from the firearm. When someone buys ammunition (unless they make their own) they aren’t actually just buying bullets but <b>Cartridges</b> (see term).</p>
  <p> <b>Cartridge:</b> so, the cartridge is both the bullet and the casing. The casing houses powder that is used as a propellant for the actual bullet. Depending on the type of firearm the “spent” cartridge may be ejected from the gun automatically (see <b>semi-automatic</b> & <b>automatic</b>). Conversely it may have to be extracted manually-- more on that later.</p>
  <p> <b>Pistol:</b> much like Rifle-- is a very broad term. Pistols from a simple standpoint have a barrel less than 16 inches. This makes things very confusing from a reporting perspective. For example, an <b>AR15</b> (more on that later) pattern rifle that has a 15.9 inch barrel but has a “pistol” brace is legally not a rifle but a pistol. At the same time the term pistol also includes <b>revolvers</b> (like what you see in westerns) and traditional handguns that everybody can own from civilians to members of special forces. It is super broad and I’ll explain it all in a bit. </p>
  <p> <b>Primer:</b> is the chemical and/or device responsible for initiating the propellant combustion that will push the projectiles out of the gun barrel. These are typically situated at one end of the <b> cartridge </b> </p>
  <p> <b>Rifle:</b> this is a broad term that I will go into further detail in a bit. From a legal standpoint a rifle is any firearm that has a barrel that is more than 16 inches. You may be thinking, wow, what a weird number? Well that just so happens to be the length that the Federal government and <a href="https://www.atf.gov/" > <b>Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives </b> </a> decided on. Rifles can be everything from single-shot rifles to automatic assault rifles. The term is very broad and I’ll explain why soon.</p>
  <p> <b>Semi-Automatic Firearm:</b> also called self-loading firearm, is one whose action mechanism automatically loads a following round of cartridge into the chamber (self-loading) and prepares it for subsequent firing, but requires the shooter to manually operate the trigger in order to discharge each shot. In other words the firearm will only fire once when the trigger is pulled.</p>


  <h3>Types of pistols </h3>
  <p><b>Handgun (hammer-fired):</b> so a hammer-fired handgun is a pistol that uses a hammer to strike the primer to make the gun fire the projectile that is loaded inside of it. These guns are <b>semi-automatic </b> and have been around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borchardt_C-93"> <b>since the late 1800s</b>.</a> If you are legally allowed to buy a firearm in the U.S. you can buy these from nearly any place that sells firearms (this varies from state to state). They are incredibly common. Popular hammer-fired handguns include the 1911, Beretta 92 and the CZ-75. Common cartridges that you will see fired from these are: .22LR, .380, 9mm Luger, .40 S&W, .45 ACP and 10MM.</p>
  <p><b>Handgun (striker-fired):</b> so, unlike hammer-fired handguns, striker-fired handguns typically do not have an exposed hammer. Rather the primer for the cartridge is struck by a “striker” insider the handgun. Popular striker-fired handguns include nearly all Glocks, Smith & Wesson Shield, and other brands. Common cartridges that you will see fired from these are: .22LR, .380, 9mm Luger, .40 S&W, .45 ACP and 10MM.</p>
  <p><b>Revolver:</b> so, you know those guns that you normally see in westerns? The ones that have a cylinder? Those are revolvers. For the most part revolvers come in two varieties: <b>single-action</b> & <b>double-action</b>. <b>Single-action</b> revolvers require the user to manually pull back the hammer behind the cylinder every single time that they want to fire the revolver. <b>Double-action</b> revolvers don’t have to do this-whenever you pull the trigger on a <b>double-action</b> revolver it also rotates the cylinder readying the next hence “double-action.” Simple right? Common cartridges you will see for revolvers are: .357 magnum, .38 special, .44 magnum and .22LR/Magnum. These aren’t all of them but just the ones you will encounter the most from a statistics standpoint.</p>

  <h3>Types of Rifles </h3>
  <p><b>Automatic:</b> is a type of self-loading rifle that is capable of automatic fire (see term <b>Automatic Firearm</b>). Automatic rifles may also be capable of fire in a <b>semi-automatic</b> firing mode as well. Others may also fire in a burst-fire mode too (multiple rounds with a single pull). Automatic rifles are distinguished from semi-automatic rifles <b>(like the AR-15)</b> in their ability to fire more than one shot in succession once the trigger is pulled. The first automatic rifle was arguably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cei-Rigotti"> <b> Italian Cei-Rigotti that was introduced in 1900. </b> </a> </p>
  <p><b>Bolt-Action:</b> is a type of rifle that requires manual action to handle cartridges loading and ejection. In a typical bolt-action rifle one operates the bolt that helps eject the spent <b>cartridge</b> from the rifle. These kinds of rifles require the user to manually extract the spent cartridge before the next one is discharged by the rifle. These kinds of rifles have been in wide use since arguably the 1800s. For example, most hunting rifles are bolt-action rifles and at the same time bolt-action rifles were used widely in World War I and World War II ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gewehr_98"> <b> see Gewehr 98</b></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosin%E2%80%93Nagant"> <b>Mosin Nagant</b></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1903_Springfield"> <b>Springfield 1903).</b> </a>  </p>
  <p><b>Centerfire Semi-Automatic:</b> </p>
  <p><b>Lever-Action:</b> </p>
  <p><b>Miscellaneous:</b> </p>
  <p><b>Semi-Automatic:</b> is a rifle that fires a single <b>cartridge</b> with each pull of the trigger. They may even be in-distguishable from automatic rifles (see <b>Colt AR15A1</b> and <b>Colt M16A1</b>). While some semi-automatic rifles were produced before 1900, they were not widely made in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Model_1903"> <b>United States until 1903</b> </a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Garand"> <b>M1 Garand</b></a>, used my the U.S. military commonly in World War II, is one such example of a semi-automatic rifle. The original <b>AR-15</b>, that was originally produced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArmaLite_AR-15"> <b> beginning in 1959</b></a>, is another example of a semi-automatic rifle (more on the <b>AR-15</b> later).    </p>
